## What is it - at all?

There are four major material categories people like use when they ask
themselves or are asked what material the part is made of they may hold in their
hands:

        - wood
        - plastic
        - metal
        - ceramic

In most of the cases they are probably right. If they get asked how parts from
these different materials are shaped into the form they hold, they will
probably describe how a carpenter forms wood into a chair or a table, they may
describe how plastic is molded into plastic parts or how molten metal is cast
into forms to build a specific metal part.

Metal Injection Molding (MIM) is one relative modern way of making complex shaped metal parts.
